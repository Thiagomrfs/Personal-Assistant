# Personal-Assistant
A voice-based personal assistant in python

# Requirements
For this project we'll need some libraries to use speech recognition and search tools, they are:

-> pyttsx3 # pip install pyttsx3==2.6
	 		With this library the assistant will be able to speak with us.
			*Due to some errors we'll be using the 2.6 version of this lib
	
-> speech_recognition # pip install speechRecognition
	 		With this library the assistant will hear us

-> wikipedia # pip install wikipedia
   		This library will help us to search things easily

-> pyAudio # pip install pyAudio
   		Because weÂ´re using the Microphone Class we'll need to use the pyAudio lib
